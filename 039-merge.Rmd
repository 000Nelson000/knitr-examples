This demo shows you how to merge the source and output blocks in markdown output. Note **knitr** puts R source and output in separate blocks by default.

```{r setup}
# first ``` are the end of previous source block; second ``` are the beginning
# of next output block
knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) {
  gsub('```\n+```', '', x)
})
```

See if it works:

```{r test}
a = 1
a
```

Source and output lived together happily ever in **knitr**.
