This demo shows you how to merge the source and output blocks in markdown output. Note **knitr** puts R source and output in separate blocks by default.

```{r setup}
render_markdown(merge = TRUE)
```

See if it works:

```{r test}
a = 1
a
b = 1:10
write(b, '')
```

Source and output lived together happily ever in **knitr**.
